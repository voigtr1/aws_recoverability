Increase Cost Estimate
The increased amount of budget allocated to our project leaves us with optimization potentials with respect to redundancy and performance. For redundancy a active stanbdy setup has
been added in us-east-2, so that we can easily failover if a region fails. For increased performance a caching layer with ElastiCache has been introduced to we are able to pre compute
and/or store and deliver frequent queries.
