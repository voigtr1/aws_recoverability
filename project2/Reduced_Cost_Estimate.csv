Reduction potential
Since we are only starting to setup the project and estimate an initial user base of 50.000 monthly users, we might be able to start with a smaller database and scale it up based on the
data we and users we will really have. Since the project is a social network application the data we need to store and functions we provide will take some time to rise.
