# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1. Change the NACL to prevent inbound traffic on TCP port 22 which is SSH.
2. Change the SG to prevent inbound traffic on the WebAppSG on TCP port 22 which is SSH.
3. Move the WebApp to the private VPC entirely and only make it accessible via the ELB.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, even in the instance that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
1.Don't allow bucket access via public routes, but rather via VPC private endpoints and move the WebApp to the private subnet as well
2. Encrypt the buckets data via Server and/or client side encryption with appropriate key management via AWS CMK.
