# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
The web application instance could be moved to the private subnet. This would restrict the attack surface even more. Additionally the S3 bucket can then be only made accessible
via internal routes and not public internet traffic from the application instance.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
It would reduce the attack surface for getting access to the secrets bucket, but it would not prevent unauthorized access entirely. because as soon as somebody would be able to 
intrude our public subnet somehow, he would still be able to get the data.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Buckets are now default encrypted by default according to the AWS documentation. However if that wouldn't be the case it would not encrypt all already uploaded data. One would have
to rerun a batch job to encrypt the existing data.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
First of all Cloudformation has a feature to detect whether resources have drifted from the initial configuration, so you are able to see whether there have been any manual changes
on the resources created by the CloudformationStack. Running an update on a stack which has drift, will very likely overwrite the manual changes which have been done to the 
environment when simply pressing update.
