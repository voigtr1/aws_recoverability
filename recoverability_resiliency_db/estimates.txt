The achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) are both well defined and will
help to understand the impact of outages or in case of a desaster recovery.

RTO:
In case of a single AZ outage the RDS MySQL database will automatically perform a failover to the configured secondary AZ. This process typically takes
up to two minutes according to AWS documentation, depending on other activites and the exact failover reason.
In case of a single region outage we will have to manually perform the failover and promotion of the new primary database. 
The process to execute a successful failover involves multiple steps and will require time until it finishes. In order
to execute a complete region failover, we would have to:
- Change the read-replica to be the new primary
- Potentially change the new primary to be a multi AZ deployment in the new region
- Update our applications to point to the new primary
- Create a new read replica in order to be in a faul tolerant state again
In order to be able to change the read replica to become a primary there needs to be as less replication lag as possible for the process
to complete quickly. It is safe to assume this process may take up to 30 minutes, so our RTO will be 30 minutes.

RPO:
As described above the failover times for single AZ outages will be up to two minutes and this would also be the time when the applications are potentially unable to store the data
. If we build our application in a way that it can buffer and reprocess messages for one minutes our RPO could be reduced further but for now we will assume it to be up to 2 minutes.
 
In case of a region outage our potential risk and data loss time is higher due to the above mentioned manual steps / replication lag. We assume that this takes up several minutes,
so we assume our RPO is 20 minutes.
